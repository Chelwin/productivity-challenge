# Productivity Challenge Helper

The android app is available [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wlxd.pomochallenge&hl=en).

Use the *backup* feature of the app to create a backup file (`*.pctb`) and copy
it from the sdcard to `backup.json` in directory of the app.

Running `python main.py` should will read `backup.json` and create
`output.xlsx` with daily work statistics per project.
